        <h1>Reimagining social media through the power of the blockchain.</h1>
        <p>
          We are creating social media 3.0 with influencers, celebrities and
          creators being able to launch their own digital currency by simply
          creating a profile with media content posted as Non fungible Tokens
          that can be owned and traded on the Tknrs network

          We would only launch tokens with the express permission of the
          creators.
        </h6>
        <p>
          There are several thousand celebrities and creators on twitter,
          tiktok, Instagram and YouTube with followings in the millions who we
          would be actively engaging before we go viral. <br />
          <br />
          We would get them on our platform and they would see the opportunity
          to create a fan driven digital economy where their digital content can
          be traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans can have the monetary
          value of their creator's currency increase significantly as they
          promote their digital currency across their channels while our native
          token holders benefit from the Weentar popularity.

        <h1>Weentar is coming</h1>
        <p>
          Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world
          population with some countries and entities actively fighting against
          its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds holding the
          fort. <br />
          <br />
          Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens
          launched all aiming to fix one problem or the other with some quite
          simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass adoption to the
          cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So down that
          even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their followers and
          have them download an app, buy into the social currency of their
          favourite person and watch their investment as is with other crypto
          currency project.
